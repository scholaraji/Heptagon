                High oil prices since 2021 did not boost the performance of the Nigerian economy as has been the case in the past. <br />
                <p id="Blog1">Rather, macroeconomic stability weakened, amidst declining oil production,</p> a costly petrol subsidy which is consuming a large share of gross oil revenues, exchange rate distortions, monetization of the fiscal deficit, and high inflation.<br />
                The deteriorating economic environment is leaving millions of Nigerians in poverty. On current trends, with Nigeria’s population growth continuing to outpace poverty reduction, the number of Nigerians living below the national poverty line will rise by 13 million between 2019 and 2025.<br />
                The economy is projected to grow by an average of 2.9% per year between 2023 and 2025, only slightly above the estimated population growth rate of 2.4%. 
                Growth will likely be driven by services, trade, and manufacturing.<br />
                risks to this growth outlook have intensified, with most of the risks coming from domestic policies, continued low (albeit recently rising) oil production, and scarcity of both foreign exchange and local currency.
                Nigeria’s economic potential is constrained by many structural issues, including inadequate infrastructure, tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, obstacles to investment, lack of confidence in currency valuation, and limited foreign exchange capacity. 
                Sustained broad-based economic growth and poverty reduction are critical to its economic stability. USAID supports the Government's poverty alleviation efforts to improve agricultural productivity and expand jobs in rural areas. 
                It also works to improve market access, increase the country's energy supply, reduce obstacles to trade, and expand access to clean water. We help develop a policy environment for small businesses and expand access to market-driven vocational and technical training linked with private sector employment opportunities. U.S. assistance also focuses on expanding access to commercial financial services, including microfinance.

                Inequality, in terms of income and opportunities, remains high and has adversely affected poverty reduction. 
                The lack of job opportunities is at the core of the high poverty levels, regional inequality, and social and political unrest. 
                High inflation has also taken a toll on household’s welfare and price increases in 2020-2022 have pushed more Nigerians into poverty.
                Extreme weather events such as floods and heat stress have become more severe and frequent, especially in the northern parts of the country.
                These climate risks have already contributed to declining per-capita food production, such that the proportion of the population facing undernutrition increased from 6.5% in 2004 to 12.7% in 2020.
                Implementation of critical macroeconomic and structural policy reforms by the newly elected government to be sworn in on May 29, 2023, can place the economy on a stronger and more sustainable path. 
                Some key macroeconomic policy measures include eliminating the petrol subsidy by June 2023, as envisaged in the 2023 fiscal framework, which should be accompanied by strengthened social protection measures.
                Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country. President Muhammadu Buhari won reelection in 2019 despite long absences and rumored ill health. The Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram has been expelled from many of its strongholds in northeast Nigeria, but attacks by the increasingly powerful Islamic State West Africa Province continue.
                There also have been lethal outbreaks of violence in the Middle Belt, Niger Delta, and northwestern regions. 
                The petroleum-based economy’s fortunes depend on the fluctuating price of oil. Agriculture, telecommunications, and services contribute to modest economic growth, but more than 60 percent of Nigeria’s 170 million people still live in extreme poverty.

                Nigeria’s economy grew by 3.6% in 2021 from a 1.8% contraction in 2020, underpinned on the supply side by 4.4% expansion in the non-oil sector against 8.3% contraction in the oil sector; non-oil growth was driven by agriculture (2.1%) and services (5.6%).
                On the demand side, public and private consumption were contributors to GDP growth. Per capita income grew by 1.0% in 2021.
                The fiscal deficit narrowed to 4.8% of GDP in 2021 from 5.4% in 2020, due to a modest uptick in revenues, and was financed by borrowing. Public debt stood at $95.8 billion in 2021, or about 22.5% of GDP.
                Annual average inflation stood at 17.0% in 2021 against 13.2% the previous year and above the central bank’s 6–9% target. Inflation was fueled by food price rises at the start of the year and exchange rate pass-through.
                The central bank kept the policy rate unchanged at 11.5% in 2021 to support economic recovery. The current account deficit narrowed to 2.9% of GDP in 2021 from 4% the preceding year, supported by recovery in oil receipts. 
                <a href="#Blog1">Improved oil exports and disbursement of the SDR allocation of $3.4 billion (0.8% of GDP),</a> pending decision on its use, helped to boost gross reserves to $40.1 billion in 2021. 
                The ratio of NPLs to gross loans was 4.9% in December 2021 (regulatory requirement 5%), while the capital-adequacy ratio was 14.5% (regulatory benchmark 10%). Poverty and unemployment remained high, broadly unchanged from 40% and 33.3%, respectively, in 2020.
                A prospering Nigeria helps pull up its neighbours; a stumbling one drags them down. It is a problem, then, that from 2015 to 2020 the economy grew so slowly that the average Nigerian got poorer in real terms.
                A commodity-price plunge in 2015 was part of the problem. Yet plenty of damage was self-inflicted. In 2019 the government closed Nigeria’s land borders to all goods, purportedly to stop smugglers competing with local producers. 
                The result was higher inflation. Efforts to prop up the exchange rate by restricting access to dollars made it hard for businesses to import basic inputs.

                Growth will decelerate, averaging 3.2% during 2022– 23, due to persistent low oil production and rising insecurity. Inflation is projected to remain elevated at 16.9% in 2022 and to stay above pre-pandemic levels in 2023, fueled mainly by rising food, diesel, and gas prices and persistent supply disruptions amplified by the Russia– Ukraine conflict. 
                Capital inflows are projected to recovery, while oil exports are projected to increase slightly. The benefit of a forecast positive oil price shock on exports may, however, be partly offset by a weak output effect due to lower oil production, stoked by infrastructure deficiencies and rising insecurity. 
                The projected marginal current account surplus of 0.1% of GDP in 2022 could turn into deficit of 0.2% in 2023. Improved revenue collection will help narrow the fiscal deficit to an average of 4.5% of GDP. Public debt targeted to reach 40% of GDP by 2024 on fresh borrowing. The headwinds to the outlook may be exacerbated by rising insecurity and policy uncertainty underpinned by reversal of initially planned removal of subsidies on premium motor spirit a year before the 2023 elections.
                Climate change’s impact is seen in crop yields declining by 7% in the short term (2006–35) and by 25% in the long term (by 2050). Projected increases in annual maximum temperature of 3–4°C between 2050 and 2070 could further undermine agricultural productivity and cause greater water stress. Already, shortages of water and grazing land are generating communal conflicts. Nigeria is 73 on the 2021 GCRI.
                The new administration, working with stakeholders, needs to develop an agenda for economic and social inclusion. At the heart of such agenda must be improving the lives of the average Nigerian. This agenda must also include a practical strategy on how to structurally transform the economy, moving labor and economic resources from low productivity sectors to high productivity sectors.
                At the top of the productivity ladder is the tradable services sector, which has the potential to improve incomes and raise overall productivity. The challenge with this sector, however, is its inability to accommodate labor in large numbers. Nevertheless, the sector is important, given Nigeria’s young population who are increasingly driving technological revolution across various sectors on the African continent.
